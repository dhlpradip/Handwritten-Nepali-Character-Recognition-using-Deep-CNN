# Handwritten-Nepali-Character-Recognition-using-Deep-CNN
This is the project that me and my team did as our final year project of Undergraduation on computer Engineering. It uses Deep CNN in written in python over Keras.
We used two optimizers, Adam and Nadam and the accuracy of Nadam model was better then the accuracy of Adam Model as we achieved validation accuracy of 99% with Nadam model.
